          It‚Äôs spooky season, and Sheepyard is releasing a small update.
          Unfortunately, there is a bit of an unforeseen situation, and the full
          changelog will have to be delayed. Find below the balance tweaks, and
          come back soon for more!

        <p>
          Continuing with their pledge to balance cards regularly, Sheepyard
          makes no exception of this release. On the menu today: some love for
          forgotten cards, and a nerf of Rain of Frogs.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='F8' /> now costs 3/2/2/2/2 (from 3/3/2/2/1). As a
            result, the amount of spawned toads is adjusted 4/4/4-5/5/6 (from
            4/5/5/6/6).
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='N77' /> now costs 6 mana at all levels (down from 7).
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='F21' /> now costs 6 mana at all levels (down from 7).
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='I17' /> now moves forward if it kills the pushed unit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='N24' /> now cost 3 mana at all levels (down from 4).
            As a result, their strength is reduced by 1 (from 2/2/3/3/4 to
            1/2/2/3/3) and their ability is adjusted (from 2/3/3/4/4 to
            2/2/3/3/4).
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='W1' /> now can freeze a unit instead of dealing damage
            if it is not frozen yet.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <Info icon='heart' title='Nerf compensation'>
          Owners of Rain of Frogs will be compensated proportionally to the
          level of the card: <Coins amount='0/15/40/120/250' /> and{' '}
          <Stones amount='0/2/5/10/20' />.
        </Info>

        <Title id='updated-freeze-mechanic'>Updated freeze mechanic</Title>

        <p>
          First of all, the freeze mechanic is being reworked. Until now, a
          frozen unit would simply skip its moving phase at the beginning of its
          next turn. That remains the case, however it also temporarily loses
          its Death Trigger Effect and its Survive Trigger Effect.
        </p>

        <p>
          That means freezing is no longer solely used to slow down the enemy,
          but can be used to avoid side-effects of attacking a unit, such as the
          elders‚Äô abilities or ‚Äòon death‚Äô effects.
        </p>

        <p>
          This impacts Icicle Burst, Frosthexers, Moment‚Äôs Peace and Midwinter
          Chaos directly, and Spellbinder Zhevana and Wisp Clouds indirectly.
        </p>

        <Title id='new-ancient-race'>New Ancient race</Title>

        <p>
          Originally announced as ‚ÄúBisanu‚Äù, later renamed ‚ÄúStoic Protectors‚Äù,
          the new Ancient card will finally be available from November 1st and
          will bring a whole new concept into the game through the ‚ÄúAncient‚Äù
          race.
        </p>

        <p>
          On play, Stoic Protectors effectively disable the ability of
          bordering/surrounding units (depending on level). This effect is
          permanent, lasting until the unit dies, and cannot be canceled. It
          only works on units and cannot be used to disable structures. This
          peculiar property makes Stoic Protectors another pretty effective
          counter to elders.

                    We are currently experiencing an unforeseen issue with
                    publishing the release on the Apple app store. We are

                    mechanic (including the Icicle Burst tweak) will be
                    released.

                  The balance tweaks will be available from November 1st with
