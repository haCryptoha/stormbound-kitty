          Itâ€™s spooky season, and Sheepyard is releasing a small update.
          Unfortunately, there is a bit of an unforeseen situation with Apple,
          and the full changelog will have to be delayed. Find below the planned
          balance tweaks, and come back soon for more!
        </p>

        <p>
          Continuing with their pledge to balance cards regularly, Sheepyard
          makes no exception of this release. On the menu today: some love for
          forgotten cards, and a nerf of Rain of Frogs.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='F8' /> now costs 2 mana at level 5. As a result, the
            amount of spawned toads is adjusted 4/4/4-5/5/6 (from 4/4/5/5/6).
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='N77' /> now costs 6 mana at all levels (down from 7).
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='F21' /> now costs 6 mana at all levels (down from 7).
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='I17' /> now moves forward if it kills the pushed unit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='N24' /> now cost 3 mana at all levels (down from 4).
            As a result, their strength is reduced by 1 (from 2/2/3/3/4 to
            1/1/2/2/3) and their ability is adjusted (from 2/3/3/4/4 to
            2/2/3/3/4).
          </li>
        </ul>
