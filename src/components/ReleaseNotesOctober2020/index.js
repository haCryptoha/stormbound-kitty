          <CardLink id='N79' /> (which will only be available from October 15th

          Following on Sheepyard’s commitment to tweak some cards on a regular

          It has been announced and snapshot a few times on Discord over the

          friendly matches are coming!
        </p>
        <p>
          When starting a friendly match with an in-game friend, it is now
          possible to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>cap the level of cards (from 1 to 5)</li>
          <li>cap the fortress level (1, 3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 20)</li>
          <li>pick the starting mana (1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24)</li>
          <li>
            set up a turn counter (10, 20 or 30; with possibility of ties as
            shown in the video below)
          </li>
          <li>apply Brawl modifiers</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Not all these settings are available to all players. They get unlocked
          as one progresses throughout the game.
