          Heroes League improvements

        <p>
          We have issued quite some Heroes League improvements in{' '}
          <Link to='/releases/04-2021#heroes-league-improvements'>April</Link>{' '}
          already and are monitoring their impact before pushing up new changes.
        </p>

        <p>
          That being said, we heard the community‚Äôs concerns about the fact that
          lost matches feel too critical in the Heroes League because they take
          away too many <ResourceIcon resource='HERO_CROWN' /> Hero Crowns.
        </p>

        <p>
          To make the <ResourceIcon resource='HERO_CROWN' /> Hero Crowns
          fluctuation smaller and solve that problem, we are setting up a
          maximum penalty of <HeroCrowns amount={-10} /> for a loss, and a
          minimum gain of <HeroCrowns amount={5} /> for a win.
        </p>

        <Title id='new-premium-pass'>New Premium Pass</Title>

        <p>
          May will be the month where the Premium Pass finally get redesigned
          and boosted. Its cost is increased to $9.99, but its rewards are now
          numerous:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li className='Highlight'>No more ads for the month.</li>

          <li>
            The daily calendar rewards. It will work the same as it has since
            the beginning, and the rewards will be closer to the original one
            from December.
          </li>

          <li>The coin cap is now 600 for the month.</li>

          <li>
            The friend limit is now 200 (up from 100). This perk is persisted
            after the end of the month. In other words, as soon as one buys the
            Premium Pass, their friend list can forever contain up to 200
            people.
          </li>

          <li>
            Three more deck slots. This perk is also persisted after the end of
            the month.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <Title id='extra-deck-slots'>Extra deck slots</Title>

        <p>
          On top of the 3 deck slots that can be unlocked via the Premium Pass,
          3 extra deck slots can be bought by all players via some in-game
          resources (in any order).
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            One of the 3 slots costs <Coins amount={3000} />.
          </li>
          <li>
            One of the 3 slots costs <Rubies amount={250} />.
