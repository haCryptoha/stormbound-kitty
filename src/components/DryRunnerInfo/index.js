          This simulator has same drawing/cycling mechanics as the game and
          should be an accurate representation of how playing your deck would
          feel. It can be useful to evaluate card cycling, mana flow and combo
          efficiency.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many game mechanics are currently implemented in this simulator. To
          learn more about which cards abilities are taken into account and how,
          check out <Link to='/faq#dry-runner-mechanics'>this list</Link>. For
          an explanation of what the drawing algorithm is, check out{' '}
