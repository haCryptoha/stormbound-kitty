        update introduces two new cards aiming at buffing the confusion
        mechanic: <WikiLink id='N78' /> (available as soon as October 1st) and{' '}
        <WikiLink id='N79' /> (which will only be available from October 15th
        onwards).

      <p>
        It has been announced and snapshot a few times on Discord over the last
        few weeks so it’s no longer a surprise for many of you: advanced
        friendly matches are coming!
      </p>
      <p>
        When starting a friendly match with an in-game friend, it is now
        possible to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>cap the level of cards (from 1 to 5)</li>
        <li>cap the fortress level (from 1 to 20)</li>
        <li>pick the starting mana (1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24)</li>
        <li>
          set up a turn counter (with possibility of ties; see video below)
        </li>
        <li>apply Brawl modifiers</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Not all these settings are available to all players. They get unlocked
        as one progresses throughout the game.

          <p>
            The “social panel” has been hyped a few times on Discord over the
            last few weeks, and is a good testament of Sheepyard’s intents to
            grow the game and its community.
          </p>
          <p>
            It features Discord, Reddit, Stormbound-Kitty (needless to say I’m
            deeply honored to be featured in the game), the Stormbound Wiki (by
            FrozenEarth) and social networks (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram).
          </p>
          <p>
            Connecting with Stormbound on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram will
            grant <Rubies amount={10} /> for each, so <Rubies amount={30} />{' '}
            total. Not bad for just a few taps!
          </p>

          <p className='Highlight'>
            Additionally, there will be many more UI improvements aiming at
            making the game overall better.

            Every day, every week, and every month (client local time 9AM), you

            (amongst the existing ones).

          <p>
            All daily packs cost $1.99, all weekly packs cost $9.99 and all
