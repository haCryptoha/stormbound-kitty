        <p>
          March will introduce a brand new league: the{' '}
          <span className='Highlight'>Heroes League</span>! It is an additional
          league after Diamond which can be reached on a monthly basis by
          passing beyond Diamond 1.
        </p>

        <img
          src='/assets/images/releases/rank_hero.png'
          alt='Heroes League badge'
          style={{ maxWidth: '300px', margin: '3em auto' }}
        />

        <p>
          This league does not have the same ranking system as the
          others‚Äîinstead it has a scoring ladder. Players move along that ladder
          based on the amount of <span className='Highlight'>Hero Crowns</span>{' '}
          they own, also known as their{' '}
          <span className='Highlight'>Hero Score</span> (HS for short). Owning{' '}
          <HeroCrowns amount={1500} /> is the same as having a Hero Score of
          1500. These are gained and lost after each ranked game performed in
          Diamond and the Heroes League (see formula below).
        </p>

        <p>
          When entering the Diamond league, every player is granted{' '}
          <HeroCrowns amount={1000} /> to start with. As they progress through
          Diamond, they already collect (or loose) Hero Crowns (see calculations
          below). When finally passing Diamond 1 and entering the Heroes League,
          the amount of Hero Crowns collected represents the current Hero
          Score‚Äîprovided it is above 1000. If the Diamond progress was difficult
          and a player was to enter Heroes League with less than{' '}
          <HeroCrowns amount={1000} />, their score would be set to 1000.
        </p>

        <img
          src='/assets/images/releases/chest_hero.png'
          alt='Heroes League chest'
          style={{ maxWidth: '300px', margin: '3em auto' }}
        />

        <p>
          At the end of the season, players having reached the Heroes League
          will be down-ranked back to Diamond 5, their Hero Score will be reset,
          and they will receive a Heroes League chest containing:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <Common amount={20} /> (+6 from Diamond)
          </li>
          <li>
            <Rare amount={16} /> (+4 from Diamond)
          </li>
          <li>
            <Epic amount={8} /> (+2 from Diamond)
          </li>
          <li>
            <Legendary amount={3} /> (+1 from Diamond)
          </li>
          <li>
            <Coins amount={3000} /> (+1200 from Diamond)
          </li>
          <li>
            <Rubies amount={100} /> (+50 from Diamond)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Players within the top 500 of the ladder will gain additional rewards
          as follow:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The 1st player in the ladder will earn a Mythic tome, one Elder tome
            and one Legendary Dragon tome (worth <Rubies amount={260} /> total).
          </li>
          <li>
            The 9 other players in the top 10 will earn a Mythic tome and a
            Feline tome (worth <Rubies amount={140} /> total).
          </li>
          <li>
            The 90 other players in the top 100 will earn a Heroic tome and a
            Dragon tome (worth <Rubies amount={100} /> total).
          </li>
          <li>
            The 400 other players in the top 500 will earn a Pirate tome (worth{' '}
