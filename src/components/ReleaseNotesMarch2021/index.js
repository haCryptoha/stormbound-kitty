        <p>
          March will introduce a brand new league: the{' '}
          <span className='Highlight'>Heroes League</span>! It is an additional
          league after Diamond which can be reached on a monthly basis by
          passing beyond Diamond 1.
        </p>

        <img
          src='/assets/images/releases/rank_hero.png'
          alt='Heroes League badge'
          style={{ maxWidth: '300px', margin: '3em auto' }}
        />

        <p>
          This league does not have the same ranking system as the
          others‚Äîinstead it has a ladder. Players move along that ladder based
          on the amount of <span className='Highlight'>Elo Crowns</span> they
          own, also known as their{' '}
          <span className='Highlight'>Elo Ranking</span> (e.g. owning{' '}
          <EloCrowns amount={1500} /> is the same as having a ranking of 1500).
          These are gained and lost after each ranked game performed in Diamond
          and the Heroes League (see formula below).
        </p>

        <p>
          When entering the Diamond league, every player is granted{' '}
          <EloCrowns amount={1000} /> to start with. As they progress through
          Diamond, they already collect (or loose) Elo Crowns (see below). When
          finally passing Diamond 1 and entering the Heroes League, the amount
          of Elo Crowns collected represents the Elo Ranking‚Äîprovided it is
          above 1000. If the Diamond progress was difficult and a player was to
          enter Heroes League with less than 1000 Elo Crowns, their ranking
          would be set to 1000.
        </p>

        <img
          src='/assets/images/releases/chest_hero.png'
          alt='Heroes League chest'
          style={{ maxWidth: '300px', margin: '3em auto' }}
        />

        <p>
          At the end of the season, players having reached the Heroes League
          will be down-ranked back to Diamond 5, their ranking will be reset,
          and will receive a Heroes League chest (20 common cards, 16 rare
          cards, 8 epic cards and 3 legendary cards, as well as{' '}
          <Coins amount={3000} /> and <Rubies amount={100} />) as well as
          rewards based on their final position in the ladder as follow:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The 1st player in the ladder will earn a Mythic tome, one Elder tome
            and one legendary dragon card (worth <Rubies amount={260} /> total).
          </li>
          <li>
            The other players in the top 10 will earn a Mythic tome and a Feline
            tome (worth <Rubies amount={140} /> total).
          </li>
          <li>
            The other players in the top 100 will earn a Heroic tome and a
            common dragon card (worth <Rubies amount={100} /> total).
          </li>
          <li>
            The other players in the top 500 will earn a Pirate tome (worth{' '}
            <Rubies amount={60} /> total).
          </li>
        </ul>

          ) from the old ranking (
