            While I have your attention, please remember the pandemic is not
            over, even if you have been vaccinated. You can still carry the
            disease and make people sick.
          </p>
          <p>
            So wear a mask and avoid unnecessary travels‚Äîespecially if you live
            in an area with rampant COVID-19 cases. It takes everyone‚Äôs effort
            to slow down this pandemic. Do the right thing. üôè

        <p>This release, like any other, brings some balance changes.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='W22' /> now trigger their ability before attacking a
            unit, regardless of its position (instead of only in front).
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='W29' />
            ‚Äôs ability now considers all friendly units (instead of surrounding
            only), but affects less units at all levels (from 2/3/4/5/6 to
            1/2/2/3/3).
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='N80' />‚Äô ability now triggers before moving instead of
            on play and their strength has been increased by 1 (from 3/4/5/6/7
            to 4/5/6/7/8).
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='N85' />
            ‚Äôs ability no longer kills friendly confused units. Instead, once
            per turn, manually dropping a unit on the structure itself (like
            dropping a unit on a free tile) will grant it fixedly forward, then
            the weakest confused unit takes 1/2/3/4/5 damage. Its strength has
            also been adjusted to 2/3/4/5/6 (from 2/3/5/6/7).
          </li>

          <li>
            <CardLink id='N77' />
            ‚Äôs ability is reworked from scratch. It now draws up to 1/1/2/2/3
            card(s) from the enemy‚Äôs hand, and reduce their mana cost by 1.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Quite uniquely, <CardLink id='N77' /> owners will be compensated with
          the usual rewards despite the card being reworked and overall buffed.
        </p>

                'The balance changes will be deployed with the season reset as usual. Temple of the Mind will be available from July 2nd along with its promotional pack (for a week). The new Brawl modifiers will be released in the next few weeks.',
