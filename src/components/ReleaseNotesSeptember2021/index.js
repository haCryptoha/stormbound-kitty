          Hello Stormbounders! A new version of Stormbound is coming early
          September, bringing balance changes, a new card, and a lot of generous
          offers to celebrate Stormbound‚Äôs 4th nniversary!
        </p>

        <p>
          Before we begin, let‚Äôs take a short moment to remember that the
          development team was quite fragmented due to well-deserved holidays in
          August and September, hence the releases being a little superficial.
          It will pick up some steam in September to deliver new exciting
          content soon!
        </p>

          <p>
            While I have your attention, please remember the pandemic is not
            over, even if you have been vaccinated. You can still carry the
            disease and make people sick.
          </p>
          <p>
            So wear a mask and avoid unnecessary travels‚Äîespecially if you live
            in an area with rampant COVID-19 cases. It takes everyone‚Äôs effort
            to slow down this pandemic. Do the right thing. üôè
