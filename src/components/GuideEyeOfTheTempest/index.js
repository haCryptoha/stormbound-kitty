        This week, all spells cost -2 mana from their initial mana cost, for a
        minimum of 0.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <p>
        This Brawl has a lot of different approaches and is a community
        favourite for this reason. The first approach makes use of spawning free
        toads and buffing them with a 4 mana <WikiLink id='N40' /> that has just
        been buffed to provide more strength for the primary target. You can get
        an insane amount of stats on the board this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, AoE spells like <WikiLink id='N29' /> and <WikiLink id='N44' />{' '}
        are also reduced, so a Winter deck featuring <WikiLink id='W23' /> and{' '}
        <WikiLink id='W19' /> on steroids might still be able to consistently
        clear the board and go the distance by attrition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Swarm is another strong contender, with free frontline satyrs and insane
        AoE board clearing and base damage spell <WikiLink id='S15' /> for only
        3 mana, just buffed from bordering to surrounding. Also{' '}
        <WikiLink id='S20' /> costs 5, so you can get a taste of how strong it
        originally was before it got nerfed twice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just for the record, Ironclad has free <WikiLink id='I3' /> available,
        but the rest of their spell lineup is not looking too strong comparably,
        so I would not expect to see much of them.
      </p>

            </h3>

            <p>
              CriticalPancake piloted this to Mythic with 0 losses last time,
              claiming it was too easy.
            </p>
            <p>
              But maybe <WikiLink id='S20' /> costing one more mana is enough to
              offset the buff to <WikiLink id='S15' /> and make it less viable?
              Maybe the more powerful <WikiLink id='N29' /> can topple it?
            </p>
            <p>
              He also mentioned that <WikiLink id='N14' /> got swapped out in
              the last games, because they were over too quickly anyways.

            <p>
              Not too many spells, but toads are just really strong, and{' '}
              <WikiLink id='F22' /> with <WikiLink id='F17' /> can steal some
              wins. The mana cost reduction makes <WikiLink id='F8' /> playable
              even if it’s not too high level.
            </p>

            <p>
              Other variations could include cheaper spells and cheaper runners,
              such as <WikiLink id='N67' /> and <WikiLink id='F25' />.

              Frostkhan’s Eye of the Tempest
            </h3>
            <p>
              The quintessential Winter attrition deck is also a scary high
              level option, but <WikiLink id='W19' /> costs one more mana
              compared to last time, so we will see if it still holds up against
              the aggression of Swarm and the buffed toad spam of Shadowfen
              decks.
            </p>

            <p>
              <WikiLink id='W21' /> could be replaced with <WikiLink id='W24' />{' '}
              to trade offence for defence and really bank on permanent health
              regeneration.
