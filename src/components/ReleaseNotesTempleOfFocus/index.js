          On January 17th, a new card will make its entrance! It’s a structure
          from Swarm of the East, it’s epic, and it’s a bit of a new mechanic
          while still making sense in the context of the overall faction! Oh and
          just like <CardLink id='N80' />, it is an ancient card. It currently
          does not have impact in the game, but it will.
