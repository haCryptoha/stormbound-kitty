## Deck Building

### Core Cards

The core of a pirate deck is the pirates, but the most important pirate is Lucky Charmers. Lucky Charmers being the beef and main win condition, your main goal when making your pirate deck should be making Lucky Charmers as easy and effective to play as possible.

The core of your deck should consist of the following:

- **Beef:** Lucky charmers, Northsea Dog (only high mana)
- **Rush:** First Mutineer, Bluesail Raiders
- **Cycle:** Snake Eyes, Goldgrubbers, Freebooters (mostly high mana)
- **Other:** Westwind Sailors, Cabin Girls

Although every pirate is not required for a good pirate deck, it is important to note that every pirate removed is a chance at not getting max strength Lucky Charmers.

### Filler Cards

Although there are only ~3 spaces left in your deck, this is where there is variation between pirate decks. The best filler cards are cheap cards, with good strength and movement. Preferably =/< 2 Mana.

Examples include: Summon Militia, Gifted Recruits, Green Prototypes, Lawless Herd, Sweetcap Kittens, and other cheap faction cards.

The flaws with having mostly pirates is it sets your Mana curve rather high. This is one reason that your filler should be cheap, there are more reasons that I will come back to later.

## Meta

### Early game

The strategy of a pirate deck changes significantly at level 1 and 2, and it is not very favorable. I would not recommend a full pirate deck to new players, rather just toss First Mutineer and Northsea Dog in your deck and it will likely give you some value.

### Middle and late game

At level 3+, the pirate deck begins to show its true colors. A good pirate deck has 2 win conditions, those being beefy units and 2-movement units. Make sure to upgrade your cards, as pirate decks get significantly stronger every upgrade.

## Combat

Thanks to the pirates abilities to cycle cards, there is a good optimal strategy for the first few turns, I will go over what your goals should be at each point in the game.

### 3- to 5-mana turns

The first few turns have a good chance at winning the game for you, during these turns you should try to:

1. Use all your mana each turn
2. Put strength on the board
3. Cycle cards to put Lucky Charmers and Snake Eyes in your hand (Lucky Charmers is more important)
4. Play, discard, or redraw all of your non-pirates
5. Have units in any of the following positions:

All of this is in preparation for the next turn.

### 6-mana turn

This is the turn that will end most battles and your goals are simple:

1. Play Lucky Charmers next to the enemy base in a way that it is protected
2. Redraw a card
3. Obtain Snake Eyes and 2-movement units

If attacking may cost you your life, you might choose to defend instead.

If you can’t put it on the base, or don’t have a full hand of pirates that’s fine, although you might consider waiting another turn. Do remember though: playing other cards and waiting may result in drawing some of your non-pirates back into your hand.

### 7-mana turn and onward

Assuming your opponent has not conceided or died, your next goals should be:

1. Rush if you can finish them off
2. Play Snake Eyes (only if you have a good board presence), followed by cheap non-pirates (this is why you want them at 1 or 2 mana)
3. Cycle as many cards as possible

The purpose of Snake Eyes and the cycling is to get Lucky Charmers back in your hand as soon as possible. If you are Lucky, you should be able to play it by the 8 or 9-mana turn.

Repeat this process: Lucky Charmers then cycle, Lucky Charmers, cycle, Lucky Charmers and so on until you win.

As you get higher and higher in mana costs, you will also be able to get more value out of Northsea Dog and Freebooters. Pirates do fairly well in the late game.

## Dealing with strategy

Pirate decks are alright early game, if you’re lucky you can even have an amazing early game. Pirates also get progressively stronger up to a very high mana amount. Here’s what to do against various strategies.

### Rush decks

Just make sure they don’t get any closer than the middle mane, if you are placing Lucky Charmers, you can let them get a little closer. Be weary of Salty Outcasts and Herald’s Hymn.

### Control/stall decks

Be fast, place Lucky Charmers before they get a good spot on the board. If they freeze it, try to prevent future freezing and do as much rush damage as possible.

Avoid late game as much as possible, Visions of the Grove and Lady Rime will ruin your day.

### Chip decks

Same as normal, avoid rush damage, never be vulnerable.

### Poison/convert decks

Use beefy units to get them to use Amberhides early, then use Lucky Charmers. Or just go for it and hope for the best.

Just make sure they don’t convert all of your units and keep your frontline up for Lucky Charmers.

### Klaxi/RoF decks

High-Priestress Klaxi likely won’t be an issue, just kill as many frogs as you can whilst putting strength on the board.

### Beef decks

Your beef is faster than theirs, just rush for Lucky Charmers on base.

### Dragon decks

Kill as many dragons as possible, don’t let them get close but be sure to leave an opening by their base for Lucky Charmers.

### Pirate decks

You can identify a pirate deck if they play quite a few pirates, or they use generic cards. Don’t let them have a good spot for Lucky Charmers, and make sure your Lucky Charmers is closer to their base then theirs is to yours.

Hope for the best when fighting pirates and remember that they will have similar cards to you. And if you are fighting MooreFunn though, you might as well concede while you still can.
