      'The bands’ melodious chimes swam through the air as if the wearisome humidity were at a civil war. The guests stepped and clapped in sync, acting as the couriers of one anothers’ souls. A hearty feast served as lining to the entire room, as the table expanded around the entire ballroom’s perimeter. Horned hosts and hostesses mingled amongst the outsiders, offering the finest bites of various shellfish and imported dwarven mead. The drunken kept in time with the dancing, anything but isolated from the masses.\nEvery invitation specifically read out only citizens of 21 years of age or older were allowed to enter the ball. However, it appears that a young faun had found her way up the stairs and to the rooftop balcony, isolated from the booming cheer below.\nShe waited expectantly, looking over the railing and down at the trade market, the repeating housing units, the town square, all equally and eerily quiet as one another. It was not normally like this, she recalled, from spending many hours a night sneaking up onto her own house’s rooftop. She grinned slightly thinking about this fact, proud that her innocence has brought her this stealthy veil.\nSuddenly, the light brought from the palace hallway behind her was shaded, but she felt no fear. Her suitor had finally arrived.\n“You really kept me waiting, huh?” She giggled, turning around to face him. His handsome visage was darkened, until he approached slowly, his mouth forming from the shadows.\n“Sorry, I got caught up with some things,” he said quietly, almost looking ashamed.\n His voice resonated deep within her heart. Gruff but still sweet, she knew he was not like the other satyrs. His glorious gilded horns shining in the moonlight, she stood silent, examining his features.\n“Uh… Is everything alright? Is it… Ugh, I’m sorry-”\n “No, no no, I’m sorry, I just got a little carried away. Please, everything is fine, I promise you.”\n He shifted nervously. “Alright, if you say so,” he mumbled and approached her, a few inches away from her.\nShe looked up into his eyes, narrow and elusive. “I’d like to ask what you’re feeling about right now,” she asked, smirking silently at the end at his obvious paranoia.\n“Not anything bad, just wanting to be here, I swear.”\n “I know it’s more than that. I can see it in your eyes.”\nHe stayed quiet for a beat. Should I tell her…?\n “Please, you don’t have to lie to me,” she pleaded, eyes wide.\n “... Yea, you’re right. I just don’t want to get caught, you being you and me being… me.”\n Her hoof stroked his face, sending a shiver down his spine. “I know you’re worried. You’ve always been that type of person. But don’t fret, I’m not afraid of you.”\nHer warm smile lightened his burdens slightly. “I… are you sure? Completely positive? I don’t want-”\n His lips were then sealed. “Shh, I’m sure, silly. I know it was only accusations, really. You could never hurt a fly.”\nHis gaze grazed the ground, solemnly looking back up to meet her eyes. I can do this, he thought. It won’t happen again, I know for sure.\nShe started to lean in. It was obvious what he had to do next.\nHe started to lean in too, matching her…\nControl yourself.\nThe soft hair…\nControl yourself.\nThe sturdy horns…\nControl yourself.\nThe tender meat…\nGod damn it, control yourself!\nHe couldn’t.\n His eyes fluttered open, reddened with an everlasting hunger. She gazed curiously into them, the curiosity changing to fear.\n He snarled, snapping his fangs.\n “What are you… No, no, I know you’re better than this, you can be different, you can change it, you can stop, please stop, no, please stop, stop-”\n Her cries were gone.\n Only crimson was left.\n He had to run.\n Fast.\n',

      '“Excuse me, my liege,” The agent bowed, nose turned to the ground. His coppery hair tied back into a neat ponytail, his cleanliness defied the stigma around the rodents’ general hygiene. While he was a sight to behold in beauty and physicality, the one he bowed to was awe-inspiring, adorned in silver and gold. \n“What is it?” She sat up in her chair, small but powerful. Her whiskers twitched expectantly as she awaited an answer.\nWithout raising his head, the agent held out a tattered, yellowed scroll, tied neatly with a ruby ribbon. “News has arrived from the Swarm. A societal disruption that might open an option for siege.” \nThe ivory mouse took the scroll up into her dainty hand, untying the ribbon, allowing it to loftily float onto the ground. Her brow furrowed as she read deeper into the passage, learning more and more on the situation.\nThe palace rooftop…\nA young faun missing…\nSuspected to be murdered…\nRaised by…\nShe scoffed. Felines? They accept those dirt-pawed ferocious beasts into their kingdom? Just another reason that the Swarm must fall.\nShe handed the scroll back to the Agent. “Gather the standing army. Tell the engineers to initiate the Seirá plan. Await further instructions.”\nNot another word, the agent nodded and marched down the hallway. Examining the walls revealed that rather than a high-quality oak, they were made out of a sturdy alloy. Exiting the throne room and leaving directly to the exit, the rodent observed the exceedingly busy streets, with many rat-tailed workers and tin automatons changing and repairing all defects. As the agent passed by these robots, random spots of rust became visible, well known to be caused from the rodents’ degrading spit. \n“Excuse me, Mykam,” The agent called out, looking up to a short but bulky rodent, holding a clipboard and standing on a high-strung catwalk. Mykil looked down at the agent. “One sec,” He called back down, scribbling down some words on the paper and intensely surveying the rows and rows of metal soldiers below. He nodded and folded the clipboard under his arm, waddling down to the metallic stairs. Coming up to the agent, he looked up at him. “So, what is it?”\nThe agent relayed his message. Mykam’s hand rubbed his chin, a single eyebrow raised. “She’s jumping the gun, ey? Well, orders r’ orders, I s’pose. I’ll get ‘em ready.” Turning to the masses, he cleared his rough throat.\n“RISE N’ SHINE, YA TIN CANS! MIAS’ GOT SOME ORDERS, SO YA BETTER BE READY FOR SOME SEIRÁ-FLAVOURED ASSAULT!”\nFlinging his arms up and fingertips spreading in the air, the workshop suddenly roared to life. Whirs and scrapping metal filled the silence, and a sea of red lights flared up. The variation in constructs was incredible, from powerful operators, to supporting golems. Obeying and awake, the robots conversed with beeps and whistles, as if they were family. The agent slightly smiled at the sight, slate-faced up until now. Mykam sighed in valor, proud of his creations. They were prepared.\nBack at the throne room, the snow-white mouse slightly skipped to the backroom. As she walked by vials of clear emerald liquid, they reflected a distorted likeness of the mouse’s visage. \n“Mia! Mia, did you hear the news?”\nThe mouse sighed before looking who called her name. She could tell that voice from anywhere. Turning, she looked down.\n“Of course I did. I’m the first to hear any news, you know.”\nThe short rat’s grin slightly narrowed, but still maintained composition. “Does that mean we can finally blow them to the void?!” His eyes shined excitingly behind rounded goggles. \nShe shifted her weight. She wanted to say yes, but chaos wouldn’t help either side. “Maybe. We will have to see. I’ll be composing a plan.”\nAs she continued walking, the small rat ran up beside her, stubby legs making it difficult to catch up with her. “Really?! Yes!” He leaped into the air with a fist pump, rattling the nearby shelves.\n“Careful! You could spill the tonics!” Mia’s stern tone came out of nowhere. His smile shrunk almost immediately. “I’m sorry…” He said quietly.\nMia took a deep breath. “Don’t be.” She continued to some large doors, opening them.\nThe rat’s smile returned. “Will we finally be able to utilize it?!” he peered through the bars guarding the edge of the small platform jutting into a soundproof chamber. \nA small dragon laid in the center. Chains wrapped around his legs and wings, strain can be seen on each link. Breathing slowly in sleep, smoke lifted out of its nose.\n“Perhaps,” she responded with a neutral face. \nMaybe it was time to teach the Swarm what it felt like to be in embers.',

      'You can be different…\nOh, how wrong she was, Kepp thought. How unfortunately wrong.\nThe blood clinging to his maw was dried easily in the brisk winds. While the Swarm dwelled in the burning dunes, nights were relentlessly chilling. Luckily, this newly nomadic dragon’s inner brimstone had kept him warm.\nWhere was he to go? He was a murderer, a traitor. The previous occurrences only led to minor damage, not nearly close to thieving life itself. This guilt, his own fallacy… He knew what would happen. Why did he ever think he could be different this time around, why did he trust her?\n“You’re lost.”\nKepp spun around, looking for wherever the voice came from. All around him, it was pitch black.\n“Who… Who are you? Reveal yourself!”\nLeathery skin brushed against his tail. How is this creature so quick? \n“Calm. You’ll enrage again if you work yourself up.”\n“How the hell do you know about that?!” Kepp demanded, seeking any and all answers from this stranger.\nA clawed foot stepped forwards. The moonlight shone down like a spotlight on Kepp, the stranger entering this sacred land. This creature’s eyes being saucers of bleach, he peered at Kepp. Wings curled inwards to his back tight, his horns rivaled even those of Kepp’s. \n“Because we are similar.”\nAnother dragon?! Kepp thought that his orphaned childhood was the only possible truth, being the only draconian born in the Swarm.\n“How… HOW-”\n“Shh. We’re too close to the walls. The guards’ll hear us. Follow me.”\nThe strange drake swiftly walked in the opposite direction, expecting Kepp to be on his tail without a word. Kepp paused for a minute, thinking if he should actually go. \nWell, I don’t have any other option.\nThey soon arrived at a small den, packed under sturdy sandstone to keep the heat in. Entering it, the dragon sent out a small spark, lighting a pile of desert brush. \n“So, ask any question,” He said, curling his tail as he sat down.\nKepp thought through everything he could ask, but maybe it would be best to start with basics. \n“What’s your name?”\nThe stranger chuckled. “Easy. Omer. The guards call me Omer the Roamer.”\nKepp thought about that name. Omer… He has heard that before. An old tale, only a myth. Could he truly be them?\n“What is… wrong with me?”\nOmer sat back. “Well, isn’t that a complex question.” He picked up his scaly hand, pointing to his chest. “Have you heard of Dragoons?”\nKepp blinked. “No, I haven’t. What does it have to do about me?”\n“So, basically, these Dragoons are-”\nA rumble grew on the outside of the cave.\n“God damn it… God damn it, we have to go!” Omer growled, rushing out of the cave. Kepp dashed out as well, not nearly as quickly. His nerves taking hold of him, Kepp looked around in the darkness, wherever the tremor could be coming from. \nInside the walls of the Swarm, loud rumbling horns blasted out sounds of caution. Kepp knew what this meant: The blood had been found.\nKepp continued running, running into the darkness, with no idea where Omer went. That strange drake… Was this a trap? \nHis claws on the soft sand, his footing faltering, he didn’t look back.\nHe was tired and alone, in the dreary midnight wind. Where could he go?\nMaybe if he went into the-\nThe sand fell beneath him, into what seemed like a pit. An iron-threaded net webbed his wings, keeping him down on the ground.\n“Ey, boys, we got one!”\nA bright light shone down on Kepp. He winced at the intensity, looking up at the sandy ledges. Curious noses poked out, red beady eyes invading his privacy.\n“Pull ‘em up!”\nHis limp body had no restraint on the net, defeated and abandoned. He sighed, hoping for the best.\nAs he was drawn to the top, one of the furred pests stuck their nose close to his face, examining him. After a second, it grinned happily.\n“Mia’s gon’ have a field day wit’ you an’ that other wyvern.”',

      '“Here, your benevolence, is the Eastern drake we captured.”\n“Brilliant. Bring him to the Bulwark.”\nKepp’s blurry vision virtually made him blind as he was thrown to the feet of whatever small being stood above him. A tight ebony muzzle tied around his jaw, he couldn’t utter a word.\nDragged by the tail, he dizzily felt as his scales were pulled across the velvet carpet, burning his surface.\nSoon after, he was relieved by a cool sensation on his scales, liberating him from the pain.\n“Get ‘em chained!”\nThat same shrill voice from the dark night before. It - No, he could tell now, from that stance - she organized this. That emerald-wearing rodent, proud at her “accomplishment”...\nOne rodent came up to unfasten the muzzle. One he removed it, Kepp growled and leaped at the leader, suddenly thrust back by the chains pulled by the furred felons. \nHe wasn’t strong enough. The chains were tied down to their posts. The mouse waltzed up to Kepp, right out of range.\n“Well, well well, well. The beast tried bitin’ the hand that feeds, ey? I’ll keep that in mind, just you wait.”\nShe turned and left, but not before she spat on Kepp. Shaking it off, he laid limp, waiting until he could have enough strength to stand. At least his vision was getting better, so maybe he could look around the room at the time…\nThe entire room was a large sphere, bolts jutting out at random angles. It appeared to be some sort of metal, but much darker than your average hammer-worn iron. It seemed tempered, special. He continued looking, and saw... \n“Oh…”\nAnother dragon. Smaller in proportion to him, but its wingspan was much more impressive compared to Kepp’s. They, too, were chained down, and a warm smog lifted from their nostrils, as they breathed slow in their torpor. Maybe he could wake them up…\nKepp rattled the chains, pulling and releasing. The ruckus echoed against the walls, but seemingly had no effect on the wyvern.\nKepp took a deep breath. Plan B, he thought, and reared back, as far away as he could get from the other dragon. He stood there, and…\nRushing to the other end of the room, as close as he could get…\nThe chains triggered, and…\nBOOM!\nKepp slammed into the ground, a painful experience, but the sound created an explosive cacophony in the walls. \n“Wh… What was th- wait, where am I? What is this pl- Who are you?!” \nThe wyvern leapt to life, brought to consciousness by the blast of sound. Kepp stood up sore, and cleared his throat.\n“Kepp, from the East.”\nThe wyvern blinked, noticing the dried blood on his maw. From the East… Those vicious creatures… He noted his caution, and preceded as he thought fit the situation.\n“N-nice to meet you. My name’s, uh.. K-Kamen.”\nKamen, Kepp thought. A Tribal name. Could they really be…? No, they’d be serpentine, weird…\n“Well, what’s the last thing you remember?”, the Wyvern asked, yearning to learn more about this wild creature.\nKepp processed his previous few hours. A lot had happened, a lot he might not want to go into.\n“Well, I was with my family, and I… There was a ball. And I’m obviously not 21 just yet, but nearing it. I thought I was responsible enough to sneak out, but I got too curious of the dunes at night, and… I was trapped.”\nKamen nodded during this. Well, he seemed truthful enough. Almost embarrassing to explain.\nKepp looked at him up and down after. “What about you? You seem like you’re native here.”\nKamen sighed. “Yea, at least I thought. Guess I’m just a test to them now,” He said solemnly, looking up at the platform. “Now that I think about it, I think I’ve heard of this place.”\nKepp turned his head. “Well, what is it?”\n“Have you ever heard of Mia?”\n“Mia… Yea, rings a bell. Ironclad ruler, right?”\n“Yup, and head chemist. She’s concepted every alloy, every tonic. Basically thought of this entire place.”\n“Woah, quite efficient, huh?”\n“I guess. Anyways, this here is apparently one of her private rooms. Not many people know what goes on them, as they are securely sound-proofed.”\n“Huh, prepared as well.”\n“You aren’t bothered by the fact that they’re specifically sound-proofed?”\n“...Well, now that you point that out-”\nThe doors on the balcony flung open, surprising both dragons. A small but proud figure looked down upon them, hands on the railing.\n“Perfect. You can both hear me, correct?”\nBoth dragons stayed silent, in fear of what would come if they attempted to jump at her.\n“I said, can you hear me?”\nBoth dragons nodded.\n“Perfect. Let me introduce myself. My name is Mia. You will both be calling me General, got it?”\nAnother nod.\n“And you’ll both go by your codenames.”\nHesitation, but a nod soon after.\n“The yellow one, De1. The black one, Eo1. Noted?”\nNothing but fearful confirmation.\n“Good to see you’re both very agreeable. Now…”\nMia pressed an unknown button behind the railing, the chains on both Dragons releasing. Bars fell down from the ceiling around Mia, encasing her in protection.\n“Fight, and the victor will get to eat tonight.”',

      '“And so when was the last time you saw Fi- Kitty?”\nThe felines sniffled and dabbed the corners of their eyes with light handkerchiefs. “The night before. She went into her room and said goodnight to us, but we didn’t hear the window open or anything. She’s snuck out before, but only to the roof, so we assumed we’d hear her…” The mom explained, on the verge of bawling. The father patted her back. “Kitty was a special goat, and we could tell that. We knew she was sneaky, but not nearly as much as… that…” His brows arched as the sorrow sunk in deeper.\nThe undead nodded and scribbled some words in her small notebook. “Thank you. I’ll be sure to bring this to the enforcement immediately.” She stood up and walked out the door, the notebook put into the satchel. The feline couple soon burst into tears, their wails reaching the ears of all nearby passersby.\nThe undead continued on the thin road, her skirt dirtying and fraying on the rough dirt. Up ahead was the Satyr enforcement department.\nFools, she thought.\nShe turned the corner as she went past the department. Not giving it a second look, she had her sights set on another building.\nThe door of the abandoned building creaked loudly as she entered, cobwebs brushing against her skinless arms. As she closed the door behind her, darkness enveloped her. Reaching to the left, her hand grasped a metal ring, which she promptly knocked on the wall.\n“Name?” A voice suddenly appeared from the dark.\n“Cubera.”\n“Come with me.”\nHer hand was grasped as she was led into the pitch black, trusting whomever brought her forth. She knew there was no danger in here, apart from the outside of the building.\nAs they went deeper, she could feel the ground incline slightly, as if entering an olden mine. The figure in front stopped suddenly.\n“Wait here.” The figure slipped into a passage, illuminated by an unseen torch behind it. Converse was heard from behind the door, but none of it was intelligible. \nAfter a moment, the figure came back out, a beard shown from the light. He held open the door for the lady, a false vindicator of the truth. “You may enter,” he said, commanding her forth.\nAs she entered, bone-rattling laughter and feathered fun erupted from the chamber. Ravens and undead alike lined the stone-hewn walls, full of tables and food. In the back of the room, two stone staircases adorned both sides of a glorious throne. And, atop that throne was an undead slouched and asleep, a small duck perched on his lap.\nCubera walked directly over to the foot of the throne, and cleared her voice.\n“King Talaf of Epsilon Noctis, I have returned with information on the Satyr murder.”\nThe undead in the chair shifted.\nCubera sighed and picked a pebble from the ground, tossing it at the waterfowl. It freaked out and flapped, squawking loudly. Garnering the attention of the entire room and waking the king, she proceeded with what she was saying.\n“King, I have info on the murder.”\nHe sat up in his chair and calmed the duck, making sure his crown was straight as well. “Do not hesitate to tell any and all.”\nCubera opened her satchel and handed him the notebook, which he took up and read through quickly.\n“So it is true. She was raised by Felines. Do you have a lead on the murderer?”\nCubera nodded. “Well, perhaps. It was said that the dragon, Kepp, was not seen this previous night, but the public has not paid much attention to him, as he had been ostracized years before.”\n“Hm. Well, we better get a hold of him. A beast that powerful can be helpful to us, especially one who is confirmed to have killed a lesser being before.”\n“I will be sure to, my King. All I need is a weapon.”\nPetting the duck, he looked down at it. “Let’s see what my adviser says.” He picked the duck up and put the beak near the side of his skull, listening intently. Nodding in agreement, he put the duck back down, the audience confused but used to his antics. “He has decided… the scythe!” The crowd cheered at the mere sound of violence, and roused even more at the sight of Talaf passing Cubera the perfect blade.\n“Thank you. I appreciate your trust greatly.”\n“Do your damnedest, soldier. Devastate any opposition just as I devastated the Queen’s palace years before.”\nShe nodded and with a grin, she thrusted up the scythe.\n“TOGETHER…”\nShe looked around the room, both dead and flightless.\n“WE WILL…”\nShe slammed down the scythe, piercing the ground.\n“SHOW THE WORLD…”\nShe waited, only a second.\n“HOW THE SATYRS DESERVE THE SAME FATE AS THE TOADS!”\nThe crowd cheered, a revolution afoot. Klaxi was their savior and their leader, not a “fair leader” like the Queen, giving power to those who are weak. The strong become stronger, the rich become richer, the worthy become legends.\nAnd no hoofed dimwit will be seen in their hall of legends.',

      '“What? We don’t have to-”\nKamen leaped and tackled Kepp, growling mercilessly. He snarled, smoky drool dripping from his jaws. “I will not go hungry tonight,” he threatened, rearing his head back. Kepp gathered all his power and forced the savage wyvern off to the side, gathering bravery and vigor. He flapped his wings and propelled himself up, straightening himself to intimidate his foe.\n“Ah, so you’re a tough guy, huh?” Kamen hissed, his face contorting into vicious humor. “Better try harder then.” His wings spread swiftly as smoke poured out in volumes, deep flames growing in a ring around him. The thick smog filled around him, expanding slowly. “Try to beat what you can’t see!” The cry from the smoke preceded a chuckle, scarily ricocheting from every angle around Kepp, no indication to the direction it came from.\nThe smoke choked Kepp, permeating and penetrating his lungs. He coughed and regained his footing, doing his best to concentrate. It’s just the normal desert air, it’s alright…\nAn unseen claw knocked Kepp forwards, a tail sweep tripping him. Kepp fell heavily, and a talon dug into his back. “This is how it ends, flawlessly, huh?” The daggers slashed deeper. “Tragic…”\n“Okay, end it!” The smoke thinned quickly, exiting through vents not seen to the naked eye. Chains were ejected from the floor, grappling Kamen’s neck. It yanked him backwards, off of his near prey. Kepp cried out as the claws were ripped from his back, blood dribbling out of the fresh wounds. Shackles seized his limbs, confirming his benign state. The cage around Mia rose upwards as she began to continue.\n“Thank you for your participation,” she said to Kamen. “It seemed that threatening famine truly motivated you, hm?”\nKamen struggled, attempting to pull against the unmoving chain. “What… are you trying to say?”\nMia shook her head. “You are both eating tonight. I only wanted to give you an incentive to show your strength. You were most moved, but as for this one… well, he might need more encouragement.” \n“You… You basard! You can’t just-” \n“Silence.” Mia pressed another button, and the chain around Kamens neck expanded into a muzzle. Another expanded around Kepp’s mouth.\n“Helia, initiate paramedic protocol.”\nThe door that Kepp entered through rattled and flew open, the same verant-dressed vermin standing in the doorway. “Already? Aight, I’ll bring ‘em in. LOGGERS!!”\nA tall golem shambled through the doorway, having to duck through it. “AT STANDBY,” it announced. “We got a damaged soldier. Go fuse ‘em up. Don’t worry ‘bout the heat.” A mischievous look grew from these words. \n“UNDERSTOOD. INITIATING REPAIR.” The robot approached Kepp, the hand contorting into a fiery tool. Kepp attempted to yell for mercy, but the muzzle stopped any sound.\nThe sparks touched Kepp’s wound, burning and forcing the flesh together. Metal merged with the scales, creating steel stripes down Kepp’s back. Kepp’s eyes filled with tears from the pain, unable to yell out. \n“RECONSTRUCTION COMPLETE.” The bot returned to the rodent. “Thank you Loggers. You can return.” both of them left the room. \nKepp’s back steamed with hot iron added to his back. The muzzles released, and Kepp mumbled quietly. \nUnsurprisingly, Kamen spoke first. “WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!” he roared to Mia, demanding for an answer. “Only the beginning of your initiation to a super soldier, Eo1. You will have the same happen to you eventually, making you much better than you ever have been.”\n“You can’t… No, I had a family, I know they’re poor, but they can find out, they’ll find me!”\nMia bowed her head. “Might you be forgetting who I am? I am the leader of this entire kingdom. I know everything that happens. I am the chains that keep this whole boat from sinking. And if anyone does so much as to attempt treason against my dream, my retribution, my salvation, the hell they shall face would be given accordingly. Do you comprehend my words or must I throw you directly to the craters?”\nKamen was silent.\nShe slammed her fist. “Do. You. Understand.”\nKamen nodded slowly.\nMia took a deep breath. “Finally. I was afraid we would have to already lose one of our best soldiers.” She turned. “Food will be deposited at 6:00 and 17:00 every day. Eat it or it will be disposed of soon after. I hope to have more in-depth conversations with each of you tomorrow.” She continued out the doors, which slammed behind her.\nKamen shook his head in fear. “We.. we need to get out of here. We can’t let this happen. Kepp, you need to help me.”\nKepp laid there, silent. \nThis is my deathbed, he thought.\nThere was no escaping.',

      '“... And that’s all for today, folks! Mirz, thank you for showing up today. And thank you, audience, for watching Dark Nights with Derk!”\nThe clap rune was played, the crystals flashed, and the televisor faded out.\n“Another successful show, boss!” The wildcat ran up to Derk with a small chilled cup, placing it on the flap of his box.\n“As usual, my friends. We’ll never even consider giving a half-pawed work to the public. These are the Heroes, the people who can control spells with their very hands.”\nAs he said that, Derk lazily stands up from his box, stretches, and walks over to the cutout of Mirz, knocking it over. “Make sure that the effects on this one are perfected. We don’t want to risk getting found out, do we?”\nThe saberpaw and wildcat shivered. “O-Of course, boss! We’ll get right to it!”\nAs the grunts ran off, Derk sighed to himself. Idiots, but the only ones I got here. Derk fixed his bowtie and went off to the backrooms, toying with the frayed curtain as he passed through. Entering his room, he sat down at the mirrors, examining his handsomeness. After a few moments, a figure walked in through the door behind him. Grinning a sharp-toothed grin, he peered at them in the mirror, paying their physical form no mind.\n“Well, well. What is it that you need now?”\nThe figure sighed. “Yes Derk, I know I owe a debt. But this is very important. I need just a little more…”\nThey trailed off, seeing Derk’s stern gaze in the mirror. Derk smiled at this, excited at their fear. “And why exactly should I give you of all people my charity again, hun?”\nThey shivered. “...Because you know me, you know what I can get you, please…”\nDerk stood up, eyes spiraling. Taking a long draw on his pipe, he placed it down, turning slowly. “Give me one example of when you haven’t leeched off of my wealth.”\nThe figure stepped back. “I.. uh..”\n“Exactly.” He walked back to his deck and ripped a drawer open, taking out a small sack. He walked back over to the figure and placed the sack in their hand. “I swear to the Goddess herself if you don’t pay back everything in full, your head will be mine. Scurry off now, I’ve got a bed to rest in.”\nThe figure reluctantly nodded. “Thank you. I promise I-”\n“I told you to scurry off.”\nThey froze, then ran off.\nMeanwhile, back at the Union, Kamen messed with wet meat, sitting next to Kepp. A heavy day of exercise ached their bones, and more metal did as well. They were slowly being forced to morph, change into disgusting draconian cyborgs.\n“Hey, K-”\nThe fear of hidden cameras silenced him.\n“...De1, do you think we’ll be able to escape from here?”\nKepp stayed quiet. His sullen gaze stared at the ground.\n“...De1?”\nThe door rumbled open, drawing both dragons’ attention. Mykam came through the door, a wrench in hand. He looked over the balcony and down at the dragons.\n“Can ya hear me?”\nThey both nodded slowly.\n“Good, good. Before you both go to bed, we have to test something.”\nThey shivered in fear.\n“Well, lemme just say… I’m sorry.”\nMykam pressed a button, and the ceiling began to open. A bright light was exposed, the dragons silently looking upwards.\nLava began to flow downwards.\nKamen and Kepp freaked out, flailing and pulling against the chains. They had to escape. They were about to die. The chains were relentless, Kepp was shackled, without finding his family, punished for... Maybe this was for the best. Maybe Kepp, the murderer, the beast, the despised creature that couldn’t even trust himself, had to go.\nThe lava enveloped Kamen, and Kepp soon after.\n\nBut what was that light.',

      '“What is the word on the seeking revenant?”\n“Only a few more hours until she reaches the Union, your highness.”\n“Good. Be sure to aid her in any sense possible. You know of the warp gates, be sure to use them. Or you’ll be the next sacrifice to the Feral.”\n“Of course.”\nThe harpy ran out of the crystal-sewn hut, which Klaxi stood as the centerpiece of. Various glowing markings adorned the floor around her, creeping up each of her staves. Closing her eyes, she resumed her tribal incantations, but not for long. Opening her eyes after sensing another disturbance, she peered from behind her mask. “What is it now?” she questioned, sensing another disturbance.\nA squat undead bowed before her with a duck in his arms. A small stone crown sat upon his head.\n“Oh, my beautiful corvus queen, might I ask for one favor?”\nKlaxi rolled her eyes. While I do appreciate fealty, this loon-loving loon really ruffles my feathers. “What is it that you seek, Talaf?”\nTalaf raised his head and fixed his crown. “I would like to join Cubera on the mission, and I heard you have the means to get me there quickly.”\nWhich of them exposed that information?!, she thought angrily. “Why, yes, I do. Follow the lazuli-lit path out of here, it will bring you straight to it.” That should keep him busy for a long while.\nTalaf jumped up excitedly and grabbed his scythe from behind his back, surprising his duck. “Oh, thank you so much! You will not regret this!” He ran out and down the path, soon out of right.\nMeanwhile, Cubera ventured across the red wastes, the Union’s walls in sight. Only a few more minutes until…\nA green portal opened overhead Cubera. She looked up at it, confused to what it meant. Maybe it was-\n“I’M HERE!!” An undead fell on top of Cubera, knocking her down. Ravens fell to the sides of each of them, strategically landing. Cubera got up slowly, winded by the blow. “Well well, taking a break? What’re you doing, get up!” He pulled Cubera up, surprisingly strong. The portal closed as the sunk slowly over the horizon, night time nearing. They would have to get to the walls soon, with the cover of shadows.\nBack in the Union…\nThe fiery water burnt through Kamen, decimating his scales, both him and Kepp screamed in pain, they awaited their final release, the sweet kiss of death…\n\nBut what was that light?\nIn a flash, the metal in Kamen burst out, nearing the walls of the metal prison. It splattered against the walls, dripping down into a large puddle, which slowly arose…\nWings flew out of the puddle, massive claws as well. A booming roar exploded from the heat, as an impressive wyvern clawed its way out of the metallic sludge. Soon following it, more brilliant chrome joined alongside the beast, quickly forming into a smaller drake, but nonetheless ferocious. Their flames spat heavily, even hotter than the lava of their previous selves. They were undeniably deathless.\n“Ohoho, so my mechanisms DID work! Take THAT, Mia, you’ll never harness this life-regena’tion like me!” Mykam hollered. “Well, it’s time to get your shackles back on-”\nA blade tore through Mykam’s spine, disposing of him before his finger could lay pressure to the button. “Was too easy,” the assassin said, her scythe still at the ready.\n“It’s time to get you out of here!” A short undead rammed himself at the bars protecting the platform, his scythe cleaving through it like paper. He leaped off the platform and towards the back wall, tearing a large wound in it. “Let’s go, guys!” As he said this, he looked specifically at Kepp. \nKepp flew out, almost knocking down the strange liberator. Kamen tore through the wall, his strength everlasting. The starless sky hung above them, they took off, sailing over the Union.\nAs Mia was getting back to her kingdom, the blasts of explosions echoed across it. God damn it, Vaule, did you let yourself go?! She ran quickly into the gates, potions at the ready. \nEntering her palace, she found Vaule running to the front. “Mia! Did you see it? A bunch of bone and bird people ran in here and to the secret room!” His eyes were wide with excitement, just like they always were.\n“Why didn’t you… Nevermind, I need to stop them!” She ran to the room quickly, finding it devastated and magmatic. Mykam’s body laid unmoving to the side, which prompted a gasp from Mia. But then she realized…\nWhere the hell did the dragons go?!\nShe ran out the gap in the back after jumping the railing, chasing whatever is out there…\nCubera followed Talaf as he ran forth excitedly, staring up at the magnificent dragons. Busting through another wall, a siren began to come closer to their ear.\n“BREACH DETECTED. ALL CITIZENS SHELTER IN PLACE. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.”\nMetallic voices surrounded them, ironclad soldiers following in suit. They were not going to be able to get out so easily.\nMia tossed potions at the unexpecting ravens attempting to keep up with the undeads, exploding as they hit the ground. She ran over the avian bodies, attempting to catch up to the dragons.\nKamen and Kepp slung flames down upon the city, the captors of torture. So much pain occured in so little time, engaging wrath and revenge.\nKepp continued to survey the broken city, until-\nWhat\nIs\nThat\nThing?\nHis hunger struck him. A small rat, brown-furred and curious, they had the same eyes as Kitty. Kitty, the one who got him into this mess, the one who tempted him, the one who made him even more hungry.\nHe had to fill himself.\nKepp dive bombed, aiming for the small rodent, jaws open, prepared…\nA bite.\nA screech.\nA flashback.\nAnd an explosion...\n\n“Mia, can you come help me with this?”',

      '“Mia, can you come help me with this?”\n“Yes brother, I will.”\nVaule was hunched over a small box with metal bolts on the sides. His whiskers twitched as he toyed with the wires inside. Mia looked over him and into the box, examining the wires. \nHe’s always loved explosives, she thought. Vaule was special, excessively intelligent at his age. But, alas, he was cursed. His small stature was how he would be even when he grew older. He might be smart, but bullies could knock him over with ease.\nVaule looked up at her. “Can you hold this wire for me? I need to connect these other two, but can’t let this one touch any others.”\nMia nodded and knelt down, holding the wire for him. She smiled softly at his excitement, his small hands working away their mechanical magic. \n“Anddd… got it! Thanks, I’ll take that now!” He snatched up the other wire and tied it neatly, connecting it to one of the wires below the rest. Bolting the top of the box, he picked it up, only being able to carry it using both arms. “Now, be careful with this, it triggers by impact.”\n“Alright, I won’t touch it.” \nHe’d blow himself sky high if he misuses that, she thought.\nSuddenly, a rodent ran up behind them. “Mia, Vaule, come with me. We’ve been breached.”\nMia stood guard by Vaule. “Wh-what do you mean?! Is Mother and Father alright?!”\nThe rodent did not speak, and instead grabbed her hand and rushed her away.\nShe quickly grabbed Vaule’s small paw and pulled her along, rushing through the halls swiftly.\nPassing the doorways, they heard cackles echoing in each. “E–, boys, look at what we got here!” Chiming shattered followed, and cheerful voices as well.\nPassing by the throne room, Vaule pulled away. “Vaule, no!” Mia chased after him, the agent unable to stop her. \nVaule was stood staring at their father and mother sitting at their thrones, midnight-furred beasts holding blades to their necks. In the middle of them, a tall figure stood proud.\n“Stop, stop! What do you want?”\nThe figure turned slowly, their mane flowing with the movement. Squaring up his shoulders, he looked down on the mice. “We are getting what we deserve. Your parents’ debt has grown too large.”\nMia stepped forwards, but the lion’s growl sent her fleeing backwards.\n“Well Laurus, we ending them or what?”\nLaurus turned back, disregarding the unthreatening rats. “Let them get any last words out. Their children are here, after all.”\nMia’s eyes fogged seeing her parents at the hands of these cat vandals. She shivered, weak and powerless.\n“You can’t… No, you WON’T!”\nVaule charged forwards, the box in his arms. He got ready to toss it at the prowlers…\n“I’m afraid I can’t allow you to do that.” Laurus grabbed the back of Vaule’s collar, jerking him back. The box was flung out of his hands, landing and ticking…\nThe shrapnel shot out, smoke burst from it…\nLaurus ran through the smoke, a cracking noise coming from behind it....\nMia attempted to follow, but the smoke choked her out…\n...Until it cleared, revealing two feline bodies.\nAnd the bodies of her parents.\nShe fell to her knees, weeping. She didn’t have a choice in this, no control over this. Why did this have to happen? Why did… Wait…\nShe got up and turned to Vaule. Vaule, her own brother, he killed their parents.\nNo, no, he didn’t mean-\nBut he still did-\nHe’s only 7-\nHe made the-\nChaos is bad. They need order. He needed to be controlled. She walked over to him, scooping him up in a hug, her tears staining his small shoulder.\n“Mia, will they come back?”\n\nHis voice echoed in her head as she watched the demonic drake swoop down and end him.\nShe looked around her, her beautiful utopia to keep control and keep peace, destroyed.\nShe stopped.\nWas it even worth the attempt?\nThe drake was flung back and laid limp, possibly dead. For good.\nMia took out a small remote, clicked a button, and spoke into it.\n“Initiate Argus.”\n“But you said Sei-”\n“Do as I say.”\n“...Okay. Done.”\nThe ground around the waste rumbled. Sinkholes appeared at random in the roads, being filled in by titanium bodies. They overrun the streets, every single one heading east.\nThey took her parents, they took her glory, they took the only one she had left.\nShe had nothing left to lose.\n',
